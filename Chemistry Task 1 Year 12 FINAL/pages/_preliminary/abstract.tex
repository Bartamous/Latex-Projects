\textit{Carbon dioxide is an essential component of our atmosphere, with this study looking at the manufacturing of soft drinks and its relationship to Le Chateliers equilibrium theory in addition to Trautz and Lewisâ€™s collision theory. \\
The history and how fizzy/soft drinks were discovered, and then first initially sold with their dubious medicinal properties will be discussed. \\
Further discussion will be made on the relevant chemical equations used in the production and manufacture of soft drinks such as Coca-Cola and how factors in equilibrium and collision theory play a role in the manufacturing of these drinks. \\
Lastly, the impacts that soft drinks have on the laws, societies, and environment will be examined with examples such as in the Tamil Nadu area and Cuba.}
