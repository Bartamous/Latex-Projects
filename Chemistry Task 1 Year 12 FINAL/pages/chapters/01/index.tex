\section{Introduction}

Carbon dioxide is a vital part of the earth's ecosystem and makes up approximately 423 ppm (parts per million) of the atmosphere right now (Mauna Loa Observatory, 2024).
Carbon dioxide is made up of two molecules, one carbon molecule and two oxygen atoms, with the oxygen atoms having a double bond with carbon, cancelling the net dipole movement, thus making it a nonpolar gas (Belford, 2016). \\

This study will discuss how carbon dioxide is used in the manufacture of soft drinks and the effects and behaviours of Le Chatelier's equilibrium within this system; additionally, Trautz and Lewisâ€™s collision theory will be discussed throughout the study. \\

The process of how carbon dioxide turns into carbonic acid within a carbonated beverage such as Coca-Cola and artificially carbonated waters will be observed.
In addition, the manufacturing process of carbonated soft drinks will be discussed and its impacts on the law, legislation, environment, and socioeconomic aspects of the process.
