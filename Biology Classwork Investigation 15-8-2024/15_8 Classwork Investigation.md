INVESTIGATION 

For multicellular organisms to function effectively and live successfully so that they can reproduce and pass on their genetic information, there needs to be a high level of organisation in the arrangement of their specialised cells. 

AIM: To justify the hierarchical structural organisation of organelles, cells, tissues, organ systems and organisms.

METHOD

1. Use a number of sources to research the levels of organisation in multicellular organisms. Interactive  activities could be very useful in achieving the aim of this investigation. 

2. When using a search engine, insert key words such as 'levels of organisation in multicellular organisms' + 'interactive' 

DISCUSSION

Using the information you have gathered:

     a. Create a flow chart that places the following levels of organisation in order from the least complex to the most complex (organs, cells, organelles,        

        tissues, organisms, organ systems). 

     b. Write a summary of each level of organisation listed. 

     c. Create an illustrated flow chart showing the relationship between each of the levels of organisation.

     d. Include Harvard style bibliography. 

CONCLUSION

Write summary sentences related to the aim of this investigation.
